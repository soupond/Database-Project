## 📝 Project Overview

This project walks through the end-to-end process of building and querying a relational database:

1. **Requirements & Analysis**  
   – Captured in the project report (`DBPROJECT.pdf`)  
   – Includes entity definitions, relationships, and use-case scenarios  

2. **Schema Design & Data Population**  
   – SQL DDL to create tables, constraints, and identities  
   – Sample data inserts to illustrate typical records  

3. **Query Development**  
   – A suite of SELECT, JOIN, aggregation, and filtering examples  
   – Demonstrates common reporting & analytics patterns  

4. **Lessons Learned**  
   – See `Issues Faced During Project.pdf` for challenges (data integrity, constraint handling, performance tuning) and how they were resolved
